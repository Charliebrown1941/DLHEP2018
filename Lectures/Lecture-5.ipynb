    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "`git` is a Version Control System (VCS), typically used to organize the source code of software project but also good source of documents or web-pages. An instance of `git` server stores repositories, each typically containing the code relevant to a specific project. Users create local `clones` of repositories, change and develop the local copies of the code, `commit` the changes to their local repository, `push` to the server as a contribution,  \n",
    "`pull` updates from the server, and `merge` changes between local and remote versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides cloning, repositories can be branched or forked. A repository generally starts with a `master` branch that evolves as push requests are merged in. Creating a new branch from an existing branch creates a snapshot of the which can evolve independently or be merged in later. Branches are easy to make and delete, and can serve various purposes. They can represent a stable version of software package. Or a parallel development for different operating system. A fork of a repository is a standalone instance of the repository which can be stored and managed independently from the original, where you can work independently without constraints or interference. \n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](github.com) provides a massive publically accessible instance of a `git` system besides sharing code, projects can be developed by the open source community. It provides tools for managing your repository and a wiki for documentation. Contributions to public software on GitHub generally require making a merge request which would be judged by the managers of the repository. That's why most software packages enourage you to create a new fork, so you can work independently.\n",
